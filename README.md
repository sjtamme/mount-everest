# mount-everest

I'm using elevation data from Earth Explorer and creating custom contours in QGIS to show the elevation in feet around the summit of Mount Everest. I'm adding the contours to Mapbox and using the Outdoors style to also show the two main trails and the different camps along Mount Everest.
